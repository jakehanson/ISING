Bare bones code used to ensure the Ising simulation correctly picks out the 2d critical temperature using the Binder Cumulant. The code has been stripped down in order to test the core algorithm for a wider range of lattice sizes. The thermal averages for the Binder Cumulant were taken over 1e7 simulation steps.
