## Overview
This directory benchmarks the Ising codes from the root directory using the Binder Cumulant. The Binder Cumulant U4 is a moment ratio of magnetization that is independent of system size when the system is near the critical temperature. Thus, it can be used to numerically determine the critical temperature and benchmark against the known 2d critical temperature of 2.269185 (see figure below).
